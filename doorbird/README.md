Download the above jar file and place it in the addons directory.

See README here. This will be updated as I work on improving the documentation (it's a little sparse at the moment).

https://github.com/mhilbush/openhab2-addons/tree/doorbird-binding-bnd/bundles/org.openhab.binding.doorbird

This binding depends on some 3rd party libraries that are not part of the openHAB distribution.
These libraries are contained in the *doorbird-deps-1.0.0.jar* file located in this repository.
Download this jar file and place it in your addons directory **before** downloading and installing the *org.openhab.binding.doorbird-2.x.0-SNAPSHOT.jar*.

There are still some features missing from the binding:

- channel for video stream (or URL of video stream)
- others???
- channel(s) for motion and doorbell history images
